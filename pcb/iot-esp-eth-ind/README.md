## Overview

This directory contains KiCAD project files, generated PCB images, Gerber, panel configuration files, interactive HTML based assembly list, bill of materials and position (pick & place) data.

Components of the **iot-esp-eth-ind** board has an operating range of -40॰C to +85॰C. Board layout has 4-layers and is designed according to the JLCPCB impedance controlled stack up of [JLC04161H-7628](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance).

PCB panels can be automatically generated with KiKit (KiCAD plugin). Configuration files are in the related directory.
