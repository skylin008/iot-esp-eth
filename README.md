A hardware design which includes ESP32, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB and serial connectivity. **iot-esp-eth** is suitable to use as a gateway between Ethernet, Wi-Fi and serial. When used with [esp-at](https://github.com/espressif/esp-at) project, you can connect wired or wireless networks with AT commands sent to USB or serial ports. You may also operate it with custom firmware, since it is not different from a usual ESP32 development kit.

**iot-esp-eth** may be used as an attachment to a base board. Standalone usage with USB supply is possible as well.

ESP-IDF automatic bootloader activation is supported on USB port. This port is connected to UART0 of ESP32.

Schematic, PCB layout and antenna design are available in this repository. **iot-esp-eth** is compatible with many example projects at [espressif](https://github.com/espressif/) github repository.
